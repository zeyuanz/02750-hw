    "The purpose of this question is to implement Importance Weighted Active Learning (IWAL) algorithm. For this question, you will not use modAL, but instead will implement IWAL routine from scratch using scikit-learn, NumPy and native Python. In this question, we will use a simple synthetic dataset for a binary classification problem. Each data point has only 2 features. The dataset is provided in 2 files -- “data_iwal.npy”, which contains features and “labels_iwal.npy”, which contains labels. For simplicity, you will implement bootstrapping rejection sampling subroutine with logistic regression and hinge loss.   "
